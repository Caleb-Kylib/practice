        <p>   Welcome to Helpgrove charity.

            We chose Turkana, a region in remote north-western Kenya, bordering Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda as a starting point for our program. The region suffers from poor infrastructure and very few job opportunities – if the model works here, it could work anywhere.

                 The county’s semi-arid climate makes sustainable agriculture very difficult
                  , so that the majority of food supplies have to be transported from regions several hours away.

                Most of its population still follow traditional pastoral living habits in relatively poor conditions. 
                Local businesses include basket weaving, mechanical repairs and small kiosks, however none of these scale to provide widespread employment opportunities or meaningful wages.
             The youth are the most directly affected, having little opportunity to find a job and move beyond subsistence livelihoods in their home region. And yet, with around 1 million inhabitants 
             Turkana holds an untapped potential of human talent with the great opportunity of internet access even in some of the most remote are

        <p> Helpgrove was founded in 2020 by a group of individuals who shared a common vision: to create lasting change in Africa. 
            Our founders were inspired by the resilience and spirit of African communities and believed in the potential for transformation through collective action.
            Over the years, we've grown into a reputable and dedicated charity organization, working hand in hand with local partners, communities, 
            and volunteers to address pressing challenges and create opportunities for growth
